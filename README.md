A memcached server wrote in NodeJS (using CoffeeScript), following the protocol described at
http://code.sixapart.com/svn/memcached/trunk/server/doc/protocol.txt

## roadmap
Future releases to be made as soon as I have some free time :)

 * v 0.1 - Basic implementation of get and set methods
 * v 0.2 - Implementation of other methods like: delete, add, replace, append, prepend
 * v 0.3 - Implementation of LRU algorithm to keep the cache size up to a configurable size
